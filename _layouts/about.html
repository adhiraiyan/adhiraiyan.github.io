          Hi üòÉ, I'm Mukesh, Welcome to my Blog.
        </p>

        <p>
          My background is in Electrical Engineering and Physics and I started my machine learning journey 4 years back
          as an undergraduate researcher and taught myself everything I know with the help of online resources,
          few great mentors and great projects from work. And now, I consult for startups and a few big companies and
          I mentor learners like you.
        </p>

        <p>
          From my time mentoring students from a wide range of background, I found three major groups who lack the
          necessary resources and I write this blog for you all:<br>
          1. Students looking to get a deeper understanding of Artificial Intelligence principles.
          I would highly recommend starting from <a href="https://www.adhiraiyan.org/ai/what-it-means-to-have-ai">What
            it means to have Artificial Intelligence</a> so we are on the same
          page. <br>
          2. Data Scientists working in the industry looking to learn about best Machine Learning practices
          and tools to make their work easy.<br>
          3. Business professionals looking to learn about the value AI can bring to your business.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
          My mission is to build a platform for you where you can come to learn about Everything related to Artificial
          Intelligence.
        </p>
